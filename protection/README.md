# Protection Files

This folder contains cryptographic proof that the Fieldborne OS package is protected and timestamped.

## SHA-256 Checksum

- File: `Fieldborne_OS_Full_Protected_Package_SHA256.txt`
- Hash:d2809116031f3713121d464f7bf91dd174a27fb14180ce6b729700aeecca712b
- ## Timestamp Certificate

- File: `Fieldborne_OS_Full_Protected_Package_SHA256.ots`
- This file is an OpenTimestamps receipt proving the SHA-256 hash existed at the time of timestamping.
- Use [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org) to verify the proof of existence.
This certificate ensures the integrity and authorship of the Fieldborne OS package, timestamped immutably via the Bitcoin blockchain for long-term proof of existence and protection.

**Added cryptographic validation files and documentation for Fieldborne OS.**  
This includes the SHA-256 checksum and an OpenTimestamps receipt for verifiable proof of existence.  
Ensures immutability, authorship integrity, and blockchain timestamp verification of the protected package.
